# Website for helping ideas
Because ideas need support we are publicly developing a nonprofit portal for cooperation on them. [about](/about)

## Publish description
For community to develop a project with you. You can also join any public idea to discuss it, collaborate on it or just to observe and get entertained. If you believe in an idea, promote it across your friends and organizations.
 * you can do it in person
 * by mails
 * here, *on 2do.net*
 * on almost any website *(we use GitHub, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn and ResearchGate)*

Join ideas now or [get notified](www.2do.net)

# Communieties helping nonprofit projects
Website under public development.
[*learn more*](/about/development)

## Cooperatives' projects
Describe an idea or ongoing nonprofit project and share it for others to discuss, join, supply or reward. We value direct contact between people, so no charges/commisions are taken (2do.net is maintained by volunteers).

## Mission: helping projects
Currently we are focused on developing a website for sharing, finding, joining and supporting ideas. Right now, every project is accessible to anyone on the Internet: we plan to develop a system, where you can choose who can see your projects, and where your data is stored. 

1. Describe your project
2. Publish it on 2do.net, GitHub or social media to get people involved
3. Collect feedback
4. Collaborate with people 
5. Develop with the help of the communities.
