# Ideas network
Portal for projects support under public development by free-to-join communities. 
[*About development*](/about/development)

## Community cooperatives' projects
Describe an idea or ongoing nonprofit project and share it for others to discuss, join, supply or reward. We value direct contact between people, so no charges/commisions are taken (2do.net is maintained by volunteers).

## Mission: helping projects
Currently we are focused on developing a website for sharing, finding, joining and supporting ideas. Right now, every project is accessible to anyone on the Internet: we plan to develop a system, where you can choose who can see your projects, and where your data is stored. 

1. Describe your project
2. Publish it on 2do.net, GitHub or social media to get people involved
3. Collect feedback
4. Collaborate with people 
5. Develop with the help of the communities.
