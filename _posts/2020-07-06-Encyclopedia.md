* **Content tagged** by language, format, length, complexity, license to use/modify and more. 


## Requirements
* open access 
* non-profit (fully free of charge)
* maintained by volunteers 
* open source

# Needs
1. Discussion - *what do you think about this idea?*
2. Development
	* Analysis
	* Desing
	* Prototyping
	* Testing
	* Deployment 
3. Servers
4. Content
5. Promotion
6. Maintenance



## Description
Portal for learning. Encyclopedia, where each topic is briefly defined and has a list of associated educational materials. Each piece of content (article, presentation, online course, video, visualization, infographic, game, podcast etc.) is described in the language, details it covers, knowledge it requires to be understood, for whom it is recommended, length, file format, price and the right to use/modify.

In further steps, an algorithm will be used to generate content optimised for learning specific topics, depending on the user's current knowledge and educational background.
