*nonprofit project*

**rules** | public | open source | MIT

**Assumptions**
1. Information is crucial for education
2. List of educational materials is necessary
3. TBD

# **Goal**
Encyclopedia, where each definition is associated with list of educational materials.  
* **website** - list of nonprofit projects to join
* **software** - for organizing projects 
* **servers** - choose where your data is stored (seslect or start a server)
* **foundation** - for supporting common good projects 

### Requirements

* **open access**
* **user generated content**
* **servers**
* commission/fee free 
* maintained by volunteers 

# Description
Portal for learning. Encyclopedia, where each topic has short definition and a list of associated educational materials. Each material (article, presentation, online course, video, visualization, infographic, game, podcast etc.) is described in the language, details it covers, knowledge it requires to be understood, for whom it recommended, length, file format, eventual price and the right to use/modify.

This database will allow to develop an algorithm generating personalized lecture on the topic user wants to learn depending on his knowledge and providing with necessary information to reach the user's learning goal.

This portal would also boost teachers cooperation: with other teachers, students and media specialists (graphic designers, programmers, movie makers, game developers). It would promote cooperation on  selected materials: teachers could work together on same materials sparing time and improving the educational quality.

**administration**

**development**

**finances:** Raisings by paypal. Specified cause and administrator required. You cannot collect funds for the whole projects: you must set up a specific raising for each need. Donations to authors allowed only by dedicated raisings.
