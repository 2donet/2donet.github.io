# Supporting peoples' ideas
Everybody has  ideas, but also problems with their development. We promote ideas for people to supportem them with a discussion, collaboration and sharing resources. 

## Network of projects
We are developing internet place of cooperation, where you (individual, organization or anonymous) can publish an idea for people to develop.
* **crowdsourcing** is the idea for collaboration of strangers. Publishing project to the people allows them to make them happen: comment, cowork and support. Most popular crowdsourcing website is GitHub.com, but people crowdsource also on Facebook.com and Reddit.com. As we haven't developed tool for crowdsourcing on 2do.net, we use Github, Facebook, Reddit and [more](/communities)
* 2do.net is a **nonprofit** project **only for nonprofit projects** - we want to support peoples' ideas and develop a system that protects [Intelectuall Property](/ip).
* **open source** means that anyone can study your work, help you and use it. We apply open source in our projects, but content you send to a project might be only used for its development (people won't be able to use your work for their own/other projects)
* **servers** - we are currently using GitHub's servers. You can share your server with us or donate us money for maintaining servers (GitHub's servers have limited use, which does not allow high traffic and many changes)
* **verification** - every project must be already published on the Internet. It allows us to verify if it's a real project. In the future we want Users to be able to get verified by Institiutions, Universities, Organizations and other Users. [more about verification]()

## Development
You can [join](), [support](), [comment]() or [contact us]()

## Progress
We are developing a website and software for cooperation on ideas.
* website to publish a project
* software for private cooperation on projects from your own server
