> I founded 2do.net, because I always had multiple ideas and lacked skills, knowledge, resources and time to make them happen. I am studying in Warsaw applied physics in biology and medicine on molecular biophysics specialization (focusing on neuroscience) and journalism on specialization of promotion strategy (writing thesis on "Social movements promotion"). My dream is to research nervous system using Free-electron laser.
