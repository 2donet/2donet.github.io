# **People:**

### Piotr Putyło
*founder and head administrator:*
> I founded 2do.net, because I always had multiple ideas and lacked skills, knowledge, resources and time to make them happen. I am studying in Warsaw applied physics in biology and medicine on molecular biophysics specialization (focusing on neuroscience) and journalism on specialization of promotion strategy (writing thesis on "Social movements promotion"). My dream is to research nervous system using Free-electron laser.

# Supporting peoples' ideas
Everybody has  ideas, but also problems with their development. We promote ideas for people to support them with a discussion, collaboration and sharing resources. 
* describe your idea/project 

### Who are you?
We are volounteers: a group of polish students, but you can join us no matter you education and nationality: [click here to join](/join).

## What are you doing?
We are developing a portal for connecting people to ideas. Each idea constists of description and forums on different websites (like Facebook, Reddit, GitHub and ResearchGate). Adding and joining ideas is open to public: you can either describe a project or join a community that has already been launched. Currently we accept only **nonprofit projects**. 

## Network of projects
We are developing internet place of cooperation, where you (individual, organization or anonymous) can publish an idea for people to develop.
* **crowdsourcing** is the idea for collaboration of strangers. Publishing project to the people allows them to make them happen: comment, cowork and support. Most popular crowdsourcing website is GitHub.com, but people crowdsource also on Facebook.com and Reddit.com. As we haven't developed tool for crowdsourcing on 2do.net, we use Github, Facebook, Reddit and [more](/communities)
* 2do.net is a **nonprofit** project **only for nonprofit projects** - we want to support peoples' ideas and develop a system that protects [Intelectuall Property](/ip).
* **open source** means that anyone can study your work, help you and use it. We apply open source in our projects, but content you send to a project might be only used for its development (people won't be able to use your work for their own/other projects)
* **servers** - we are currently using GitHub's servers. You can share your server with us or donate us money for maintaining servers (GitHub's servers have limited use, which does not allow high traffic and many changes)
* **verification** - every project must be already published on the Internet. It allows us to verify if it's a real project. In the future we want Users to be able to get verified by Institiutions, Universities, Organizations and other Users. [more about verification]()

## Development 
We are realizing three goals.
* **website** for supporting projects
* **software** for managing projects from your device (P2P)
* **foundation** to apply for state grants and support peoples' ideas [more](/foundation)

### For whom is this project?
This is for individuals and organizations to develop nonprofit projects (you can remain authorship for your work or stay anonymous.  

### How does it work?
Author posts an idea's description. Other users can develop this idea as a project on their own or in communities. People should b
