2do.net is a crowdsourcing project: [join us](/join)

## about crowdsourcing 

**Crowdsourcing** - the idea for cooperating with strangers: allowing people to join development makes people able to give feedback, collaborate on solving problems and supplying with necessary resources. It is an invitation for doing things together. Whether you are a scientists publishing research articles, teenager commenting posts on social media or a big corporation supporting a nonprofit organization - you are crowdsourcing.

*example: Linux is the most popular operating computer system working on servers. All of its details are accessible to the public: it is free to use, study and modify. People use it, because they see exactly how is it working, are able to apply modifications and have the right to use it also for commercial purpose.*

# Why? **Because there is power in the public**

Creating solutions requires knowledge. Studying a topic takes time, when usually there are people all over the planet who have been already focusing on it for years. 

People join initiatives, because they want to get involved in interesting projects, practice, verify skills, socialize, entertain  and to be a part of a change. 

Development is impossible without necessary resources. By convincing people to your idea you have a chance of it making your ideas real.

*example: [Readee](https://2do.net/2020/07/06/Tales-Personalization.html) is an idea for platform that generates personalized stories for children in digital form. On one hand it brings together people with ideas, story writers and graphic designers. On the other hand, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who want to create such a story. It will work is through an app that will make a tale with characters chosen by user.*

## How? Communication

To cooperate with people you need to understand one another. For achieving a goal or coming with a result you must agree on:
* rules
* goals
* assumptions

Those are a must for any project to happen, because collaboration needs agreement. Internet makes it possible to send a message, but it is your challenge to make it understandable.

*example: GitHub.com is a place where people can suggest edits to a text files. You can add a new sentence, remove a comma, report a bug or share an idea for a change. It is maintained by Microsoft and used mainly by programmers.*

## Where? In [open internet communieties](/join)

Internet makes it possible for people to exchange information, that is crucial for a project to succeed. Beside GitHub, most advanced crowdsourcing tool, there are multiple websites where people cooperate:
* **Facebook** - groups, conversations, fan-pages, file sharing and one of the worldâ€™s biggest communities make it possible for people to change the world.
* **Reddit** - users scattered across specific topic-related communities called subreddits are staying up-to-date, being entertained and creative thanks to user-generated-content.
* **ResearchGate** - portal where scientists share their articles, discuss, study and explore the world.

*example: [Facebook develops its technology on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react) by public cooperation on React, a lego-like system for creating a website: almost fifteen hundreds people have made a change to it.*

## When? The time you want
Keep in mind that whatever you publish on the Internet can be used by anyone. Be sure that you are not breaking any law when publishing.. Though publishing allows other to cooperate with you, it makes it possible for people to compete with you.
